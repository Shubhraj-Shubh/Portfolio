              Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm <span className="text-blue-600 font-semibold">Shubhraj Singh Dodiya</span>,
               a 3rd-year BS Chemistry student at IIT Kharagpur with a CSE minor and a Reliance Foundation Scholar. Somewhere between balancing molecules and coding, I got hooked on building cool stuff that actually helps people.

I've built projects like SplitMate (a trip expense splitter that saves friendships), TalkSpace (a chill platform for video calls, chats, and study sessions), and CrackCourse AI (an AI-powered course generator that makes learning smarter).

When I'm not juggling React hooks or fixing CSS bugs, I'm grinding on Codeforces and LeetCode, chasing that next rating boost and solving tricky competitive programming problems. Tech and coding aren't just hobbies, they're my way of life.

Always learning, always building, and always up for a challenge. Let's code something awesome!
